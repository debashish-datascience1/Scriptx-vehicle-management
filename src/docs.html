        <h2>Working with API.</h2>
        <p>We used axios module as our api support library.</p>
        <p>Each Components holds its own logic and every API call are made in their corresponding component.
            You can easily modify it in the component.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Some api calls are made in vueX store ( store.js file ) as we need to access it in multiple components
                which
                is
                made easier by doing so.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We have included full API documentation in the separate file which you can check out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Styling</h2>
        <p>In our application we mostly used scoped css for better management and one single global scss file which we
            included
            globally because it holds the font / color etc basic default styles.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>In some components we had to use global styling ( not scoped ) to make sure it applies to third party
                library
                based components.</p>
